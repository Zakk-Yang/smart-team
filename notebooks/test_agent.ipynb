      "Let me summarize what has been done so far:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Initial Request:\n",
      "- User requested to write a script to get the latest TSLA stock price using yfinance library\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Task Flow:\n",
      "- The Orchestrator Bot analyzed the request and transferred it to the Code Bot since it involved coding tasks\n",
      "- The Code Bot executed several steps:\n",
      "   a. Created a virtual environment named 'python_env'\n",
      "   b. Installed the yfinance package\n",
      "   c. Made two attempts to execute the code:\n",
      "      - First attempt failed due to a KeyError with 'regularMarketPrice'\n",
      "      - Second attempt succeeded using an alternative method (history())\n",
      "   d. Successfully retrieved TSLA stock price: $430.60\n",
      "- The Code Bot transferred control back to the Orchestrator Bot after completing the task\n",
      "\n",
      "3. System Architecture in Action:\n",
      "- Demonstrated the proper flow of control between bots:\n",
      "  * Orchestrator Bot → Code Bot → Orchestrator Bot\n",
      "- Showed successful error handling and adaptation when the first code attempt failed\n",
      "\n",
      "The system worked as designed, with the Orchestrator Bot properly directing the task to the appropriate specialized bot (Code Bot) and handling the return of control after task completion.\n"
